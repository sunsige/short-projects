# Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Key Terms

- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG): A technique in AI where a large language model accesses new or recent data outside its training set to provide better answers and improved results.
- Vector database: A search engine or database that stores vectorized documents, enabling more accurate information retrieval for AI models.
- Embeddings: Representations of text data as vectors in a high-dimensional space, allowing similarity comparisons between different pieces of text.
- Azure AI Search: Microsoft's cloud-based search service (formerly Azure Cognitive Services Search) that offers retrieval augmentation capabilities for large language models.
- Comma separated value (CSV): A common data format where values are separated by commas, used in this transcript to demonstrate RAG implementation with a vector database.
- Pandas library: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly useful when working with CSV files.
- Qdrant: Software used for creating an in-memory vector database search, enabling efficient text retrieval and embedding storage.
- Sentence transformers: A tool to encode sentences into numerical representations (embeddings) that can be compared using cosine similarity or other distance metrics.
- Cosine distance: A measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors in a multi-dimensional space, often used in text analysis and information retrieval.

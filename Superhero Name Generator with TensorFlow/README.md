# Superhero Name Generator with TensorFlow

- Create a neural network and train it on a small dataset of superhero names to learn to generate similar names
- The dataset has over 9000 names of superheroes, supervillains and other fictional characters from a number of different comic books, TV shows and movies
- Create a character level language model that will predict the next character for a given input sequence
- Given a seed input (a single character or a sequence of characters), the model will generate the next character that it predicts should after the input sequence
- This character is then added to the seed input to create a new input, which is then used again to generate the next character, and so on

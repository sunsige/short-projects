# Creating Multi Task Models with Keras

- Use Keras' functional API to create a multi output model
- Train model to learn two different labels given the same input example
    - Model has 1 input and 2 outputs
    - A few of the shallow layers will be shared between the two outputs
    - Use a ResNet style skip connection in the model
- TensorFlow as our machine learning framework

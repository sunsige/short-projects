# Deep Learning with PyTorch : Generative Adversarial Network

- Implement Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network using PyTorch to generate handwritten digits
- Create a generator that learns to generate images that look real
- Create a discriminator that learns to tell real images from fakes

## Objectives

1. Use DataLoader to load dataset into batches
2. Create Discrimnator Network
3. Create Generator Network
4. Understand Training loop to train GAN model
